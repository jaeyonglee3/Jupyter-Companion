# This is Jupyter Companion!

Jupyter Companion is a powerful VS Code extension designed to enhance your Jupyter notebook experience. With Jupyter Companion, you can effortlessly add new cells to your notebook for any topic or prompt you need. Say goodbye to tedious manual typing or laboriously using GPT in another window or browser. Let the extension handle the content generation for you.

## Features
- Utilize the OpenAI API to generate prompt-based content for new cells.
- Effortlessly add informative cells for programming tutorials, explanations, and more.
- Enhance your coding and learning experience with AI-powered assistance.

## Known Issues
- Having more than 1 .ipynb file open at a time may cause an issue where the extension is unable to recognize that a .ipynb file is open (you may be presented the error message "No .ipynb file open")
